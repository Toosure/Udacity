Project 4 Data Wrangling for We rate DogsÂ¶
Introduction
This is a project about the rating of dogs from WeRateDogs Twitter archive. Here I will wrangle data from 3 main source. The first dataset is from WeRateDogs Twitter archive which can be downloaded manually as twitter_archive_enhanced.csv. The second dataset is image_predictions.tsv which i will download using the request library. Lastly, I will query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file.
